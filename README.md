### What I learned

**(1)**. Sometimes when coding a desgin we can find inconsistent values between similar elements. This may be something not intended by the designer. The best is to double check with the designer to make sure this is not intended before doing to many tricks to handle these design situations. By converting a design to screens we can always improve the intention started by the designer.
Copying static designs to the pixel does not make a lot of sense.

"As developers we should be extracting the systems and the intent ouf of the design" (@AlexKMarshall)

**(2)**
I wrote a scss mixin to handle the card text color based on the background color lightness. Under a certain value, the text color will dark. Above, the text color will be light.

```scss
@mixin color-scheme($bg, $text) {
  @if lightness($bg) < 50 {
    color: $clr-white;
    background-color: $bg;
  } @else {
    color: $text;
    background-color: $bg;
  }
}
```

---

### Continued development

Improve the card style to make the styling more flexible. Add other custom data atrributes comming from the HTML maybe to control how the card look.
